# ComS327Assignment1

My homework meets specifications. I did not include hardness and just did simple tunnels.
They might look like there aren't enough tunnels, depending on the seed but that is because
they are overlapping.

Specific methods to look at:
createRooms() - Room creation.
createTunnels() - Tunnel creation.
createShortestPath() - Creating shortest path.
addRoomsToGameMap() / addPathToGameMap() - Adding rooms and paths to game map.
printDungeon() - prints the dungeon.
