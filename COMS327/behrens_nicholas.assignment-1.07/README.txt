This assignment is up to specification.
If the file does not exist in the home directory, the program will run through
and exit with a status code of 1.

If the lines of the description of the monsters are longer than 77 characters, the
program will skip that monster, I am not sure if this was how it was intended to be or not.

To run, compile fileReader.cpp with g++.
