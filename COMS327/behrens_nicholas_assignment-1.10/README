I have implemented ranged combat and a poison spell.

For the poison spell, you press p, interact with the arrow keys to place the poison,
and press p again when you are satisfied with the placement. The poison takes away
10 hp from whoever is standing on it every move cycle (code can be found in move.cpp at lines 123 and 328).
The poison also does not decay over time, so caution must be used when applying it!

For the ranged combat, you press r and select the position with the arrow keys,
and then confirm the selection with r again. The code for this can be found in io.cpp,
starting on line 1342. The weapon must be of the ranged type.

If anything doesn't work, please let me know.
