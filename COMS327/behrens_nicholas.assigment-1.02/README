# ComS327Assignment2

My code for this assignment runs almost to spec.

One thing that I couldn't get was how to make the file I load in have no limit to the amount of rooms there can be.
This is currently gated by the MAX_ROOMS variable, defined at the top of the program.


Another thing that happens, is related to loading and saving at the same time.
At this time, if you load or save individually the functionality works and the load can be run multiple time and get the same value.
The problem is when you load and save at the same time.
What happens is when it is saved, the hardness array is shifted to the right by one.
I am pretty sure this is a problem with how I am reading the bits.
However, when I tried to do the right reading of the bits, I encountered other problems that were worse than this one.

One other thing that you will need to do before running it is to place a file called "dungeon.rlg327" (without the quotes) in your home directory.
