My assignment is up to specifications.

The only thing is that both of my stairs are in the same room as the PC.

I also have had some valgrind leaks. Two of them are relating to the room,
so I am not sure with the bug if this needs to be changed. The other is a leak
of zero bytes, so I don't know if I need to deal with that.

This can be changed if need be, just let me know.
