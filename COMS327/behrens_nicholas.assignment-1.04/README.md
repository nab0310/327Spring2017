# ComS327Assignment4

This assignment is not completely up to specification. All of the monsters should have the correct behaviors.
When the monster gets to the same room as the PC, it never really gets to the exact spot that the PC is,
so I made the endgame happen when the PC and the monster get close to each other.

I think that this was a large part in due to my implementation for having separate and confusing if loops
for my movement of the monsters. If I were to do this again, I would have spent more time organizing and structuring
my solution rather than just jumping in a coding a solution.

Also, my monsters may get stuck in the corners of rooms on occasion even if they should be able to tunnel out.

Note, if an intelligent monster doesn't see the PC or doesn't have a last known position, it stays still.
